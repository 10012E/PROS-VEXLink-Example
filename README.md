<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<div align="center">
  <img src="images/Final.png" alt="VEXLink" width="60%" height="60%">
  </div>
  <br>
This is a basic example of how you can use the PROS extension on VSCode and the VEXLink system to communicate with your device and your robot.

Here's why:
* Have you ever been working on auto and when you want to find coordinates you need to check either the brain or controller.
* * Maybe your controller is in a place that is difficult to access
    * * Possibly in a match and you want to monitor how your coding is doing to make adjustments
* Need to check motor temps to see if their over heating
* Tuning PIDs

Of course, this is <strong>not</strong> a example to copy without understanding. It's important to understant how projects work in VRC. This README will explain how this works! ðŸ˜„

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries in this example.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Here we'll explain the basic framework of this code.
<br><br><br>

With PROS 4 using the main.h file is absolutely necessary, if not used your program will error and fail. So the program starts by including this file:

```sh
#include "main.h"
```
### Define What Your Sending
For this example I chose to take information from a motor. You may use any type of device in VRC that is legal. The general process stays the same. Refer to the <a href="https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/v5/pros-4/index.html">PROS Documentation</a> for information regarding taking information from external sensor and devices.
My code was the following:<br>
```sh
pros::Motor motor(10, pros::MotorGears::blue); // Adding a Blue Motor to the port 10
```

I also added a controller so I can control the speed of the motor to test my function. Refer to other repos for info on how to create this.


### Sending Data
This is when things start to get a little tricky, however, they are still relatively simple. Let's go through it ðŸ™‚:

<br>
Right before we dig in, we surrond all of this in a while (true) loop, this insures that the program will continue to scan for new information. If we didn't have this then the data will only be sent once.
<br>
```sh
std::uint32_t motor_temp = motor.get_temperature(); // Get the motor
```
To explain this we need to dive into a bit of simple syntax:<br><br>

std::  =  refers to a common c++ library, named Standard Library<br>
uint32_t = Unsigned Integers = integers only 0 and + numbers. The 32 refers to the size of the number:<br>

| uint  | Range |
| ------|------ |
| uint8_t  | 0-255 (2^8)  |
| uint16_t  | 0-65536 (2^16)  |
| uint32_t | 0-4294967296 (2^32)|
| uint64_t | 0-18446744073709551615 (2^64)|

Some sizes are overkill for our situation.<br><br>

What I did for this was create my variable for motor temps, so I ended up using the uint32_t.<br>
```sh
    std::uint32_t motor_temp = motor.get_temperature(); // Get the motor
```

The next thing that we'll look at is the "if" "else" bl0ck of code
