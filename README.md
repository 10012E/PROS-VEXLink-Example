<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<div align="center">
  <img src="images/Final.png" alt="VEXLink" width="60%" height="60%">
  </div>
  <br>
This is a basic example of how you can use the PROS extension on VSCode and the VEXLink system to communicate with your device and your robot.

Here's why:
* Have you ever been working on auto and when you want to find coordinates you need to check either the brain or controller.
* * Maybe your controller is in a place that is difficult to access
    * * Possibly in a match and you want to monitor how your coding is doing to make adjustments
* Need to check motor temps to see if their over heating
* Tuning PIDs

Of course, this is <strong>not</strong> a example to copy without understanding. It's important to understant how projects work in VRC. This README will explain how this works! ðŸ˜„

### Built With

This section should list any major frameworks/libraries in this example.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Here we'll explain the basic framework of this code.
<br><br><br>

With PROS 4 using the main.h file is absolutely necessary, if not used your program will error and fail. So the program starts by including this file:

```sh
#include "main.h"
```
# Define What Your Sending
For this example I chose to take information from a motor. You may use any type of device in VRC that is legal. The general process stays the same. Refer to the <a href="https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/v5/pros-4/index.html">PROS Documentation</a> for information regarding taking information from external sensor and devices.
My code was the following:
```sh
pros::Motor motor(10, pros::MotorGears::blue); // Adding a Blue Motor to the port 10
```

I also added a controller so I can control the speed of the motor to test my function. Refer to other repos for info on how to create this.
### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
   ```js
   const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
   ```
